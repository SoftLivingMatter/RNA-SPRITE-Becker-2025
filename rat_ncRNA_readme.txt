mature, high confidence tRNA sequences from Rattus norvegicus (Rat Nov. 2020 mRatBN7.2/rn7)

"How is the high confidence tRNA gene set classified?
tRNA-derived repetitive elements, whose primary sequences are very similar to real tRNA genes, have been commonly found in a lot of vertebrates, some worms, and some plants. To address this problem, we applied a multi-step post-filtering process to the predictions in large eukaryotes by using EukHighConfidenceFilter from tRNAscan-SE 2.0. The tool assesses the predictions with a combination of domain-specific, isotype-specific, and secondary structure scores in two filtering stages on top of the pseudogene classification, and determines the "high confidence" set of genes that are most likely to be functioned in the translation process. A small number of the predictions that have high scores but atypical features such as unexpected anticodons are separately marked for further investigation.
